# The N-word Counter Bot

[![Python application](https://github.com/Vaiterius/N-Word-Counter-Bot/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Vaiterius/N-Word-Counter-Bot/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

User said the n-word? CAUGHT IN 4K ðŸ¤¨ðŸ“¸

## IMPORTANT: Bot is running.

Inspired by the original (banned) N-Word Counter from 2020, with my own take on it. There seems to be a newer counter bot after mine [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1433112842470559775&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands) so go check that one out.
